# chs.xyz

Built off my [frontend Chess.js API](https://github.com/JoahG/chess.js).

## To play chess by yourself:

Check out the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/JoahG/chs.xyz/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repo, along with its corresponding [live demo](http://www.joahg.com/chs.xyz/). There you will find a simple, purely frontend Chess game (don't forget to check out the "Game Options" in the footer of the demo ;)).

## To play chess with a friend:

Everyone knows that playing chess with a friend is _way_ more fun than by yourself. To play with a friend, check out the more robust, Ruby On Rails-backed, websockets-enabled version in the [`master`](https://github.com/JoahG/chs.xyz) branch of this repo. It is also running at [chs.xyz](http://chs.xyz).

To play chess online with a friend, simply:

  1.   Goto [chs.xyz](http://chs.xyz).
  2.   Grab the auto-generated URL (will be in the form of `chs.xyz/XYZ`).
  3.   Give that URL to your friend, and tell them to connect there.
  4.   When they connect, you're good to go!

Since this is my first project involving Websockets, it is entirely possible that it is buggy, if so, feel free to email me (me@joahg.com), or to [open an issue](https://github.com/JoahG/chs.xyz/issues/new) to report it. Thanks!
